# Hotel/Hostel Fetching Troubleshooting Guide

## Problem Description
There is a problem with fetching hostels/hotels via Gemini API in the travel tourism application.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Missing Environment Configuration
The most likely cause is that the Gemini API key is not configured in the environment variables.

**Symptoms:**
- Console shows "Gemini API Key Loaded: Not Found"
- Hotel search returns fallback data instead of AI recommendations
- Error messages about API key not configured

**Solution:**
1. Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory
2. Add your Gemini API key:
   ```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your-actual-gemini-api-key-here
   ```

### 2. How to Get a Gemini API Key
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the generated API key
5. Paste it in your `.env` file

## Testing the Fix

### Step 1: Test API Key Configuration
Run the test script to verify your API key is working:

```bash
cd server
node test-gemini.js
```

**Expected Output:**
```
=== Gemini API Test ===
âœ… GEMINI_API_KEY found: ...abcd
âœ… Gemini model initialized
ðŸ“¤ Sending test prompt...
ðŸ“¥ Response received: {"status": "working", "message": "Gemini API is connected"}
âœ… JSON parsed successfully: { status: 'working', message: 'Gemini API is connected' }
âœ… Gemini API test completed successfully!
```

### Step 2: Test Hotel Search
1. Start the server: `cd server && npm start`
2. Start the client: `cd client && npm start`
3. Navigate to the hotel search page
4. Search for hotels in a city
5. Check the server console for detailed logs

## Debug Information

### Enhanced Logging
The application now includes enhanced logging to help debug issues:

1. **API Key Check**: Logs whether the API key is found
2. **Prompt Logging**: Shows the exact prompt sent to Gemini
3. **Response Logging**: Shows the raw response from Gemini
4. **Parse Error Logging**: Shows detailed JSON parsing errors
5. **Fallback Handling**: Logs when fallback data is used

### Console Output Examples

**Successful API Call:**
```
Gemini API Key Loaded: ...abcd
Sending prompt to Gemini: Recommend hotels in Mumbai for 2 guests...
Raw response from Gemini: {"hotels": [...], "locationInsights": "..."}
Parsed hotel data: { hotels: [...], locationInsights: "..." }
Hotel data from Gemini: { hotels: [...], locationInsights: "..." }
```

**API Key Missing:**
```
Gemini API Key Loaded: Not Found
Hotel search error: Gemini API key not configured. Please set GEMINI_API_KEY in your .env file
```

**JSON Parse Error:**
```
Raw response from Gemini: Here are some hotel recommendations...
JSON parse error: Unexpected token H in JSON at position 0
Raw text that failed to parse: Here are some hotel recommendations...
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "API key not configured"
**Solution:** Set up the `.env` file with your Gemini API key

### Issue 2: "Invalid API key"
**Solution:** 
- Verify your API key is correct
- Check if you have sufficient quota
- Ensure the API key has the right permissions

### Issue 3: "JSON parse error"
**Solution:** 
- The Gemini response format may have changed
- Check the raw response in the console
- The fallback system will provide sample hotels

### Issue 4: "Network error"
**Solution:**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the Gemini API service is accessible
- Check for firewall/proxy issues

## Fallback System

The application includes a robust fallback system that ensures users always get hotel results:

1. **Primary**: AI-powered recommendations from Gemini
2. **Fallback**: Sample hotels with realistic data
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with user-friendly messages

## Performance Considerations

### API Rate Limits
- Monitor your Gemini API usage
- Consider implementing caching for repeated requests
- Set up usage alerts to avoid unexpected charges

### Response Time
- Gemini API calls may take 2-5 seconds
- The application shows loading states during API calls
- Fallback data is used if API calls timeout

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Checks
1. Monitor API usage in Google AI Studio dashboard
2. Check server logs for error patterns
3. Verify fallback system is working correctly
4. Test hotel search functionality regularly

### Updates
- Keep the Gemini SDK updated: `npm update @google/generative-ai`
- Monitor for API changes and deprecations
- Update prompts if response formats change

## Support

If you continue to experience issues:

1. Check the server console for detailed error messages
2. Run the test script: `node test-gemini.js`
3. Verify your API key is valid and has sufficient quota
4. Check the Google AI Studio dashboard for any service issues
5. Review the enhanced logging output for specific error details

## Quick Fix Checklist

- [ ] Created `.env` file in server directory
- [ ] Added valid Gemini API key to `.env` file
- [ ] Restarted the server after adding the API key
- [ ] Ran the test script to verify API connectivity
- [ ] Checked server console for error messages
- [ ] Tested hotel search functionality
- [ ] Verified fallback system works when API is unavailable
